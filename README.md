Face Recognition-Based Attendance System is a Python web app that automates attendance via real-time face recognition using OpenCV and KNN. Users register by capturing face images, then the system recognizes faces through a webcam and logs attendance in daily CSV files. It offers a contactless interface ideal for small offices &amp; classrooms.
